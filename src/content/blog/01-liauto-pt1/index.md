Hey, so... I'm working to make myself known in the professiona world... awesome...

And honestly, I'm not a big poster. I'm def not a big poster on socials. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) has become... a necessary device for career engagement. And that's the issue. So let's look at that.

Problem statement: *How can I be social on social media with minimal actual engagement, while showing off a skillset, touching on current topics, AND adding content to this super cool new site I've been tooling away at?*

Answer: Automate it with AI.

Yes, yes.. I get it. I hear it coming.

> *But Jeff, is it **real** authentic interaction with the people you are connecting with if you phone it in with AI?*

Short answer: **Absolutely.**

The proof is here in this blog pudding. I look for interesting articles and share that info, along with how I was able to share it.

Bing, bang, boom. You get cool content, I get to build cool automation, *then* you get to learn about said automation.

Win, win, cherry on top.

Let's get started.

Note: I'm writing a little looser here since I'm not in my "professional project" file. I have linked that though. Feel free to read through that too.

## The plan

Hereâ€™s the game plan, all built out with make.com as the backbone of the operation:

- **API Integration:** Using services like [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/), [Perplexity AI API](https://docs.perplexity.ai/home), and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to create a fully automated pipeline for pulling in fresh, interesting content.
- **Automation Expertise:** Setting up workflows in [make.com](https://www.make.com/en) to handle complex scenarios and keep everything running smoothly.
- **Scripting and Scheduling:** [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) works in tandem to fetch and filter news regularly, avoiding duplicates and keeping the pipeline clean. This pulls news articles every 30 days. Free tier blues... Still works.
- **Content Optimization:** AI tools step in to summarize and adapt content specifically for LinkedIn, so posts hit just right for the professional tone I want to reach the audience with.
- **Social Media Engagement:** By automating, Iâ€™m learning what drives engagement while crafting posts that actually resonateâ€”without needing to stay glued to the screen, read countless articles, and actually get me away from the computer at times.
- **Data Management:** My workflows ensure that every post is relevant, accurate, and consistent. No surprises, just solid content.
- **Scalable Solutions:** The best part? This system can grow with new tools and platforms, so itâ€™s built for the long haul.

With make.com at the core, Iâ€™m automating my way to an optimized, professional LinkedIn presence. I let the tools do the heavy lifting while I focus on the more interesting parts: creating, learning, and sharing.

## The news

If I want to "talk" about something, I need a topic. This is where newsapi.org steps in.

NewsAPI allows for me to poll the web for news articles on topics while also limiting the domains I search. This... works... but not in the way I'd like it to. Here's an example of how this would work utilzing the API running Python:


```
from newsapi import NewsApiClient

# Init
newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='XXXXXXX')

# /v2/top-headlines
top_headlines = newsapi.get_top_headlines(q='bitcoin',
                                          sources='bbc-news,the-verge',
                                          category='business',
                                          language='en',
                                          country='us')

# /v2/everything
all_articles = newsapi.get_everything(q='bitcoin',
                                      sources='bbc-news,the-verge',
                                      domains='bbc.co.uk,techcrunch.com',
                                      from_param='2017-12-01',
                                      to='2017-12-12',
                                      language='en',
                                      sort_by='relevancy',
                                      page=2)

# /v2/top-headlines/sources
sources = newsapi.get_sources()
```

Super cool, but I am a Google Workspace user and I'd like to pull from AppScript to get into a Google Sheet. After some tinkering.. say hello to getAgilenews:

Next time we'll see what we do with this!
