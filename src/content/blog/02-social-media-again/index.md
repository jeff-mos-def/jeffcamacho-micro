## Why I’m Moving to Bluesky

Let’s be honest—social media hasn’t exactly felt fun for a while now. For me, X (formerly Twitter) was never appealing enough to really dive into. Between the endless monetization schemes and the constant drama, it felt like more of a headache than a place to connect. 

Bluesky, though, feels different, reminding me *kind of* like Reddit in my college days. People hanging out and sharing news and pet pics.

I'm trying to be more "social media" forward thinking, so this looks like a great place to start. 

## What Is Bluesky?

Bluesky is a decentralized social media platform designed to give users more control over their online experience. It focuses on authenticity and user-driven interactions rather than being dictated by algorithms or monetization strategies. Originally conceived in 2019 as a project within Twitter by its then-CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky became an independent platform in 2021.

The platform runs on the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol), which prioritizes decentralization and interoperability. This approach allows users to control their data and customize their social media experience, including choosing the algorithms that influence their feed.

As of November 2024, Bluesky has grown rapidly, with over 20 million users. This growth reflects the platform’s increasing appeal to those seeking an alternative to platforms like X (formerly Twitter), which have been criticized for their heavy reliance on monetization and algorithm-driven feeds. Bluesky’s design offers a simpler, ad-free experience where real conversations take priority. It’s fully up and running, minus a few setbacks (like today's outage), but it's heading in the right direction.

Bluesky's CEO Jay Graber gave a great interview on CNN here:

## A Fresh Start That Feels Right

Bluesky feels like social media should—fresh, open, and easy to enjoy. It reminds me of what online platforms used to feel like: a place for real conversations without all the clutter. It’s not overly crowded, and you get the sense that people are genuinely there to connect, not just shout into the void.

## Real Conversations Without the Noise

One thing I’ve really noticed is how *actual* the interactions feel. There aren’t bots or algorithms shoving random content into your feed, and you’re not constantly bombarded by ads or sponsored posts. It’s **nice** to be part of a space where the focus is on the people and the conversations, not on what’s being sold to you.

## No Paywalls or Performance Games

Another thing that sets Bluesky apart is how straightforward it is. You don’t need to pay to boost posts, subscribe to creators, or fight through walls of promoted content to see what you care about. The platform just lets you connect with people without feeling like you’re part of some marketing strategy.

## Why I’m Skipping X

X has been in the news a lot lately, and not for the best reasons. From the push to monetize every possible feature to the constant controversies, it’s become clear that the platform just isn’t for me and my push to be more open to the web. I’d rather spend my time in a space that feels lighter and more positive. Bluesky is giving me exactly that.

## Ready to Explore Something New

Bluesky has given me a reason to *want* to post social media again. It’s simple, real, and focused on what matters most: connection. I’m starting out from the ground floor, but so far, it feels like a better fit for how I want to engage online.

If you’re looking for something that feels less chaotic and more enjoyable, give Bluesky a try. And if you’re already there, let’s connect—I’d love to hear your take on it!

All the best.
