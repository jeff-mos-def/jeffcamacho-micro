Last night, I had the privilege of being a panelist for an Incident Response Drill with [The KEY Community](https://www.thekeycommunity.org/), a group dedicated to supporting veterans, military members, and their spouses. It was a powerful reminder of why I volunteer with organizations like this.

Here's the drill we covered:

> Scenario Overview:
>
> A vulnerability scan conducted on the organization's network detected a serious threat. An open-source application in use by the organization is found to be infected with a virus that is creating a security risk. Every 5 minutes, the virus opens a backdoor, allowing an attacker to gain access to the system for 90 seconds. The organization's cybersecurity team has 30 minutes to investigate the issue, isolate the threat, and follow established Risk Management Framework (RMF) protocols to mitigate the risk.
>
> Lab Scenario for Students:
>
> Objective: Identify, contain, and mitigate a vulnerability found in an open-source application infected with a virus, using NIST and RMF guidance within 30 minutes.
>
> EVERY 5 MINUTES YOU LOSE $100,000

The drill put participants in a high-pressure scenario: a company losing $100K every five minutes due to a major cybersecurity threat. Their mission? Identify the vulnerabilities, contain the issue, and strategize a mitigation plan—all while navigating the stress of a simulated crisis.

What stood out was the way everyone brought their unique skills to the table—problem-solving, teamwork, and a calm, focused approach. These qualities reflect the discipline and leadership that many veterans bring from their time in service, and it’s inspiring to see them applied in a cybersecurity context.

Volunteering with veterans groups has become a meaningful way for me to give back. I believe in creating opportunities for individuals to transition their skills into rewarding careers, and cybersecurity offers a perfect fit. It's a field that values resilience, quick thinking, and a readiness to face challenges head-on—all traits veterans know well.

These experiences also remind me of the power of mentorship and community. Whether it’s through a hands-on drill or a conversation over coffee, being able to support and learn from others is something I deeply value.

To anyone considering ways to give back, I can’t recommend working with veteran-focused groups enough. The impact is mutual—they gain tools for their next chapter, and you gain the satisfaction of being part of their journey. And who knows? You might walk away just as inspired as they are.

Of course, I can't leave without giving props to my guys [Quinton Taylor-Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boltzdameek/) and [Luis Valdivieso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-g-valdivieso/), who are absolute pillars of the cybersecurity community.

Here’s to building a stronger community, one connection at a time.
