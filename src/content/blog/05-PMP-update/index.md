## The journey continues...

In my continued study for the PMP certification, I’ve been coming across materials that don’t just regurgitate project management mechanics, but focus on the mindset and principles of effective leadership. 

A particular resource I reviewed recently from [Third3Rock PMP](https://third3rockpmp.com/) outlined the characteristics of a strong Project Manager or Scrum Master, and it felt worth reflecting on as it connects to both my current work and my certification journey.

SO HERE WE ARE.

## Key takeaways

- **Proactivity**: There’s no bypassing the hard work—following processes and addressing deviations head-on is as critical in project management as it is in PMP preparation.

- **Servant Leadership**: This principle resonated deeply. My Agile experience, particularly in fostering collaboration and empowering teams, ties closely to this approach. It’s a reminder that leadership is about enabling success, not just directing it.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Whether iterating on Agile processes or refining my PMP study strategy, the principle of always learning and improving stands at the core of effective project management.

These concepts are a reminder to me that the PMP journey isn’t just about passing an exam, it’s about evolving as a professional into the field I want to be a part of. 

As the exam integrates Agile practices, my day-to-day work with frameworks like SAFe® provides an additional layer of alignment and insight.

## Where I’m At

- **Study Progress**: Continuing practice exams and refining notes. Resources like [Andrew Ramdayal’s course](https://tiaexams.com/course/pmpsimplifiedcourse-bundle) and PMBOK 7 remain central to my study process. I've also got some practice tests through Andrew's course and other material through Percipio, which I will be getting into later.
- **Application**: Slowly documenting my project experience, an unexpectedly meticulous step. I've gotten some help from a collegue I work with in the application process. His insight really helped me see that *I'm probably over thinking my application*. Very typical of me.
- **Reflections on Agile & PMP**: The overlap of methodologies has deepened my understanding of how to apply both traditional and adaptive techniques in project work.

As always, I’ll keep building in public and sharing updates as this journey evolves.

All the best.
