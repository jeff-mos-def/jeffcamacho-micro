## Cool tools

This collection of tools has been shaped by the work I do and the demands that come with it. Over time, I’ve refined what I use, cutting out, AKA selling, anything that adds unnecessary complexity and focusing on what gets the job done. Each tool fits into a system that balances reliability, functionality, and adaptability to different tasks.

These tools are part of how I stay productive, handle creative work, and keep things organized. It’s a setup that evolves as needed but always stays simple and effective. What follows is a breakdown of the tools that have become essential to the way I work every day.
