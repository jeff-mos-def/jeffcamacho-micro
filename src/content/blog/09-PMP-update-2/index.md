## And I've applied...

So things are getting real now!

So I haven't been writing too much over the winter "break", as holiday stuff has been going on, taking some time to be with the family, and knocking the rust off of some of my PMP concepts.

By far, the most difficult thing for me to do is actually *apply* for the PMP. If you didn't know, upon application to take the PMP, you are subject to audit on your application. I don't know why, but rejection from the process may have made me *over think the whole process*. Typical me.

This year, since I'm actually *"studying in public"* for this certification, it put some positive pressure on me to work through the anxiety of the application. So here we are!

If you'd like to see where I've been, please check the project link in the heading.

## Where I’m At

- **Study Progress**: I'm still here. In the near future, I'll start actually taking some practice tests through Percipio and Andrew's material. More to come.
- **Application**: **ACTUALLY DONE.**

---

As always, I’ll keep building in public and sharing updates as this journey evolves.

Keep wishing me luck. I'll need it.

All the best.
