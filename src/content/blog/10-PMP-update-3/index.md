## I'm APPROVED

PMI states that it takes about 5 business days to approve the applicaiton to the PMP, and boy did I check my account and email every single one of those 5 days...

This morning when I logged on for work, I decided to check my PMI account after giving that a rest for the weekend and was *very* surprised for the status change in my application! I did not get a notificaiton via email, but I'll take it.

As I've mentioned before, this has been the hardest part of the process so far. I'm a perfectionist to a fault on things I take pride in, and I wanted my application to be **perfect**. Looks like it was perfect enough!

I'm moving on from here and scheduling my PMP for 45 days out from tomorrow, which would be 1 March 2025. This gives me the rest of today to do a quick short term goal review, get some final insight from my colleagues I've been leaning on for guidance, and set the focus for the exam.

If it wasn't real enough already, it's ***real, real*** now!

## Where I’m At

- **Study Progress**: I've been doing some flashcard review, some reading, some podcast listening, along with getting some insight from others that have taken the test. This coming weekend will be my first mock exam.
- **Application**: **ACTUALLY APPROVED.**

---

As always, I’ll keep building in public and sharing updates as this journey evolves.

Keep wishing me luck. I'll need it.

All the best.
