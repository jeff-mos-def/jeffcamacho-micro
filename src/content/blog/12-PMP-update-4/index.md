## The work continues

This week has been a week of nightly reading, YouTube video watching, and mock test taking. Currently, I'm using Percipio as my test taking platform, as it lets me do either a full test, a mini test, or a partitioned test, based on what I define. It's going... ok. I still have some work to do.

My main watch for the week is Ricardo Vargas Explains the PMBOK® Guide 7th Edition Published by PMI, as listed here:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVlrxOQoSUw?si=zsaaDMeIenPXSYw_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ricardo Vargas offers a clear and engaging overview of the PMBOK® Guide 7th Edition in this video, highlighting its key principles and updates. He shares practical insights on how these concepts can improve project management approaches.

It's a great breakdown and I highly recommend it. Put it on 1.5x or 2x speeds and take quick notes of the things you're either not clear on, or need work.

Flashcard review continues as well.

Praise Percipio!

## Where I’m At

- **Study Progress**: Reading, small mock tests, flashcards, and videos. More work on the concentrated efforts and weak spots I need to focus on.
- **Application**: **ACTUALLY APPROVED.**

As always, I’ll keep building in public and sharing updates as this journey evolves.

Keep wishing me luck. I'll need it.

All the best.
