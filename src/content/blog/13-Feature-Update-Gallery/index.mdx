import Gallery from "@components/Gallery.astro";

*So*... I've needed two things as of late:

- A gallery for my blog posts
- A ***small*** break from my PMP studies

So here we are!

<Gallery images={frontmatter.images} caption={frontmatter.caption} />

---

## Needs Overview

I need a way to integrate a **gallery** into my Astro blog that allows image selection at the **blog post level** using **frontmatter**, ensuring flexibility without modifying the component. The gallery must be **styled with CSS Grid** for a responsive and clean layout. Captions should be **dynamic**, supporting **HTML links** so each post can have custom descriptions without hardcoding them in the component. This also serves as a **break from PMP studies** while improving the blog’s functionality.

### Requirements:
- **Astro Blog Integration** – The gallery must be inserted dynamically in individual blog posts, with *some* exception.
- **Frontmatter Image Selection** – Images should be defined at the post level, not inside the component.
- **CSS Grid Styling** – The gallery layout should be responsive and visually structured.
- **Dynamic Captions** – Each post should be able to define its own caption.
- **HTML Support in Captions** – Links and formatting should work within the caption.
- **Low Maintenance** – The component should be reusable without post-by-post modifications.
- **Break from PMP Studies** – This serves as both a technical project and a mental reset.

## Building a Dynamic Image Gallery in Astro

Integrating a **gallery** into my Astro blog required a flexible approach that allows each blog post to define its own images and captions without modifying the gallery component itself. The solution needed to support **frontmatter-based image selection**, **CSS Grid styling for responsiveness**, and **HTML-compatible captions** for better formatting. Additionally, this served as a **break from PMP studies** while improving the overall structure of my blog.

---

## Defining Images at the Blog Level

Instead of hardcoding images in the component, I set up **frontmatter in MDX** to let each post specify which images to display.

```
---
title: "My Blog Post"
images:
  - "DO_Optiplex.jpg"
  - "FrankenPlex_Done.jpg"
  - "LIAWS.jpg"
  - "PMP_App.jpg"
caption: "Gallery Feature / <a href='https://www.jeffcamacho.com/' target='_blank'>www.jeffcamacho.com</a>"
---
```

This ensures that image selection is handled per post, allowing different blog entries to have unique galleries without modifying the component.

---

## Passing Data to the Gallery Component

Since Astro components don’t process frontmatter directly, the data needed to be explicitly passed.

```
import Gallery from "@components/Gallery.astro";

<Gallery images={frontmatter.images} caption={frontmatter.caption} />
```

This keeps the component reusable while allowing each post to display different images and captions.

---

## Making the Gallery Component Dynamic

To ensure flexibility, the `Gallery.astro` component was designed to:

- Accept images and captions via `props`
- Render dynamically based on the frontmatter
- Support HTML captions for links and formatting

```
---
interface Props {
  images: string[];
  caption?: string;
}

const { images, caption } = Astro.props as Props;
---

<div class="gallery-box">
  <div class="gallery">
    {images.map((image: string) => (
      <img src={`/img/${image}`} alt={image} loading="lazy" />
    ))}
  </div>
  {caption && <div class="gallery-caption" set:html={caption} />}
</div>
```

Using `set:html={caption}` allows captions with HTML while ensuring the gallery remains fully reusable.

---

## Styling the Gallery for a Clean Layout

To maintain a responsive grid layout, CSS Grid was used. This ensures images scale properly across different screen sizes.

```
.gallery-box {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 20px 0;
}

.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
}

.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.gallery-caption {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

.gallery-caption a {
  color: #4a90e2;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.gallery-caption a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Now, every post can include custom image galleries with captions, formatted consistently across the site.

## Aaannnnddd, done.

This feature work successfully integrates a gallery into my Astro blog, allowing per-post customization through frontmatter while keeping the component lightweight and reusable. The CSS Grid layout ensures responsiveness, and HTML captions provide flexibility for adding links. 

**Most importantly**, it served as a productive break from PMP studies while improving the blog’s functionality.

Now back to my studies....

All the best.
