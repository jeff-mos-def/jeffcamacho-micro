SO IT'S BEEN A MINUTE.

I'm generally a *super* visual person, so I've needed a place to connect thoughts as I'm studying for the PMP. That's led to the side effort of creating a new site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build out a visual and text based space to connect my thoughts.

I've also switched over to using the [PMI Study Hall](https://www.pmi.org/shop/p-/digital-product/pmi-study-hall-pmp-plus/dp017), but that's pretty built out, so we'll just talk about this other knowledge collection here.

## Overview

As mentioned, I’ve built a second site to support my PMP certification prep: [https://jeff-mos-def.github.io](https://jeff-mos-def.github.io). It’s a digital workspace created for organizing and tracking study materials. The site is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), hosted on GitHub Pages, and written in Markdown. This setup makes it easy to maintain consistency, version content, and keep everything structured as the material evolves.

The goal from the start was to create a clean, linkable repository of notes tied directly to the PMP framework—process groups, knowledge areas, and key definitions. The site is fully public and will continue to grow as more content is added and refined.

## Content and Structure

The core content is focused on PMP process groups, knowledge areas, and essential project management concepts. Each major section has been mapped out and interconnected using Quartz’s built-in linking. Definitions follow a uniform format to keep things easy to scan and consistent.

There’s a dedicated page for term definitions here (**IN PROGRESS**):  
- [100 PMP Terms](https://jeff-mos-def.github.io/_notes/100_pmp_terms/)

This page will continue to grow. The intent is to connect each term using wikilinks so users can navigate through related topics without jumping between disconnected pages. That linking work is still in progress, but the overall structure is in place.

All five process groups and ten knowledge areas have already been documented and linked. That foundational content is complete, though new connections between related entries will continue to be added. These links aren’t just internal to single pages—they stretch across groups and knowledge areas to reflect how concepts interact in real-world project management work.

## Features

The site includes several useful features to support navigation, updates, and feedback:

- **Graph View** provides a real-time visual map of how notes are connected. As more wikilinks are added, this view becomes more valuable for seeing where everything fits. For the most "visualized" form of this, look at the [PMP Process Groups and Knowledge Areas](https://jeff-mos-def.github.io/_notes/200_process_groups/process_groups_and_knowledge_areas) portion.
- **Recent Notes** on the homepage surface new or updated content automatically, so updates are visible without digging.
- **Giscus** is enabled for comments. It’s there for anyone who wants to start a discussion or leave feedback directly on any note.
- **Bug or Correction Report** link is included to report mistakes, suggest clarifications, or call out broken links.

## Status and Next Steps

This started as a personal knowledge base, but the scope has expanded. The core structure is done. Process groups and knowledge areas are fully outlined, and the site has transitioned from just dumping notes into building a system meant to last through the rest of the certification process and beyond.

Tag cleanup is in progress. A lot of early notes used overlapping or unnecessary tags that don’t help with organization. That work is ongoing.

The current landing page is temporary. A proper homepage is in development and will replace the placeholder. The update log that currently lives in the main index will also be moved to a dedicated page to reduce clutter and keep the front of the site focused on navigation and access.

More features may be added later, but the priority right now is content quality, structure, and link integrity.
