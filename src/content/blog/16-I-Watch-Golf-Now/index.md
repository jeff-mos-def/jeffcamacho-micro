I usually don’t watch golf. I happened to be watching the Masters with my dad while we were entertaining my daughter, trying to get her to walk. We had it on in the background, but by the end, all of us were paying attention.... except my daughter. She had her stuffy.

Rory McIlroy won in a playoff and finally got the one thing he’d been chasing for years: the green jacket. That win completed a career Grand Slam—something only a handful of players have ever done.

The part that stuck with me wasn’t the record or the trophy. It was how calm he stayed when things got tough. Missed putts, a *horrible* off-the-bank shot that landed in a water hazard, he was not in a good spot. He gave up his lead, made a couple bad mistakes, and still found a way to pull it together and finish strong.

I’m not trying to turn this into some deep life lesson, but watching that reminded me how important it is to keep your head clear when the pressure hits It takes years to reach goals that matter. Setbacks are part of it. So is doubt—from other people and from yourself. But the people who stay steady, who keep showing up, eventually get their shot.

I want more of that. Not the golf. The moment. Where everything lines up and you’re ready for it. And you don’t crack.
