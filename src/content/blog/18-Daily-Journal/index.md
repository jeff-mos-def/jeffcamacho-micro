**Mood upon Waking:** Not so great sleep, but kicked the day off at 0600 as usual.

**What Gave me Energy:** Had a good amount of meetings that will drive value into an upcoming planning event.

**What Drained my Energy:** As previously mentioned, intermittent sleep.

**What I'm Grateful for:** My personal health has been pretty *eh* lately, but my daughter always brings a smile to my face.

**Sentence of the Day:** “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”

Top 3 Priorities for Today:
1. Meet with my customers for planning alignment.
2. Get back in the habit of writing. Day 0 all over again, lol.
3. Have a healthy day with my family.

Thought for the Day:

Sometimes the smallest routines give the biggest grounding. Writing this down helped me reset after a jittery start.
