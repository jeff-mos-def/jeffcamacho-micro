**Mood upon Waking:** I slept in a little bit for once. Playing with my daughter before she went to daycare was great. I felt pretty good this morning.

**What Gave me Energy:** I had a day off today, Juneteenth, so the extra sleep really helped after a hectic few days of work. I also worked on my local LLM tuning, along with some other side projects.

**What Drained my Energy:** My lingering chest injury is annoying, but I'm on the mend.

**What I’m Grateful for:** I am grateful for my family and those around me. I have been keeping my head down too long and need to look up and see where I'm at and who's there with me every once in a while.

**Sentence of the Day:** Tending to my own needs is not selfish, it's essential.

Top 3 Priorities for Today:
1. **Reconnect with Myself**: Enjoy my mid-week day off and take some time for self-care.
2. **Savor Quality Time with My Wife**: Have lunch with my wife, just the two of us - a much-needed break from work and responsibilities.
3. **Start Small on Fitness Journey**: Begin working on small steps to get back into my fitness routine after being shelved due to injury.

**Thought for the Day:** As I navigate my career, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily tasks. But taking a step back to reflect on what truly matters – whether that's personal growth, relationships, or simply enjoying the journey – can help me stay grounded.
