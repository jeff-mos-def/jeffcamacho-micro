It's everyone's favorite time of the year: **Goal creation and goal abandonment**.

I eeked by this last year on my main goal, my [PMP Certification](../blog/20-pmp-done), which I planned for completion in March... then August... and finally November.

*That's a whole other story.*

This year I have other goals, goals that I think are more self and family focused rather than just trying to "move the needle" year after year.

This year's plan is an approach I'm taking the whole year:

**2026 Core Goals Summary**

| Pillar | Primary Goal | Key Execution Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Architect (Career)** | **[AWS SAA Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)** | 60-Min Daily Deep Work (Inc. Weekends) |
| **Physical Performance (Self)** | **Lose 30 lbs** | 0.57 lbs/week weight loss |
| **The Explorer (Pups)** | **Intensive Dog Focus** | Daily Micro-Sabbaths & Post-Study Walks |
| **The Explorer (Family)** | **Wife & Daughter Connection** | 12 Micro-Adventures + 26 Thank You Notes |
| **The System (Mental State)** | **Zero Mental Clutter** | **2-Minute Rule** (Action <120s) + **1-in-1-Out** |

I'm also going to be doing a little bit of cleanup for my volunteering efforts.

For those that may not know, I've been volunteering to assist veterans, military members, and military spouses with counseling and guidance through several platforms like Veterati (now defunct), [Hire Heroes USA](https://www.hireheroesusa.org/), [MilMentor](https://www.milmentor.com/), and several others. I'll be cleaning these efforts up to better focus my impact and my intended goals of giving back to the community I serve. More to come on this.

That's really it for now. Just wanted to drop a line.

All the best.
