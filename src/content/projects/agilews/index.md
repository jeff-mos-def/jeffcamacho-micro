## KEY Community

If you don't know, I volunteer with several organizations that cater to the veteran, service member, and miltary spouse community. One of those organizations is [The KEY Community](https://www.thekeycommunity.org/).

The KEY Community continues its mission of empowering service members, veterans, and military spouses to transition into fulfilling civilian careers. Through monthly workshops, we explore essential skills that align with modern workforce demands, offering participants the tools to thrive in their professional journeys.

On December 17th, I will be facilitating this month's workshop, focused on Agile methodologies and the Scrum framework. As a seasoned Agile Coach, Release Train Engineer, and SAFe Agilist, I aim to share insights and expertise to connect the adaptability and collaboration inherent in military service to the principles of Agile development.

## Understanding Agile and Scrum

Agile, at its core, emphasizes continuous improvement, adaptability, and delivering value to customers. This approach mirrors the structured, mission-oriented mindset often found in military environments. Scrum, a framework within Agile, breaks projects into manageable increments, enabling teams to inspect progress and adapt as needed.

During the session, we’ll cover key concepts such as:

- Agile principles and their benefits, including improved project control and enhanced customer satisfaction.
- The roles within Scrum, from the Product Owner to the Development Team, each critical in achieving project goals.
- Scrum artifacts and ceremonies, such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, which facilitate transparency and collaboration.

## Translating Military Skills to Agile Teams

The workshop will highlight how military skills—discipline, communication, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing environments—are invaluable within Agile teams. Participants will reflect on parallels between military operations and the structured adaptability of Scrum practices.

## Why Agile Matters

With industries increasingly adopting Agile for complex projects, familiarity with its principles is a significant asset. This workshop is designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of Agile and Scrum, positioning them for roles in technology, business, and beyond.

## Continuing the Mission

The KEY Community is proud to host workshops like this to help bridge the gap between military service and civilian career opportunities. Facilitating these sessions allows me to contribute to that mission while supporting service members, veterans, and military spouses in their professional growth.

If you're a member of the veteran, service member, or miltary spouse community, please feel free to join us!
