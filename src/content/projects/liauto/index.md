## Project Introduction

This project is a personal pet project to explore the power of automation and AI in streamlining social media content creation. By integrating advanced APIs, automation platforms, and scripting tools, I‚Äôm creating a robust system to share Agile news and insights consistently on LinkedIn.

The system combines multiple technologies to deliver a polished and professional social media presence while enabling me to learn and grow in several key areas:

- API Integration: Utilizing services like newsapi.org, Perplexity AI, and OpenAI to create an end-to-end automated pipeline.
- Automation Expertise: Building workflows in make.com to manage complex scenarios efficiently.
- Scripting and Scheduling: Leveraging Google Apps Script to fetch and filter news content regularly without duplication.
- Content Optimization: Exploring AI-driven tools to summarize and adapt content specifically for LinkedIn audiences.
- Social Media Engagement: Gaining insights into what drives engagement and how to craft posts that resonate with professional networks.
- Data Management: Designing pipelines that ensure relevance, accuracy, and consistency in output.
- Scalable Solutions: Learning how to build a system that can evolve with new tools and platforms.

This project is about understanding how to leverage modern technology to create meaningful connections and insights in a professional space. Along the way, it provides an opportunity to deepen knowledge in automation, AI, and social media strategy.

As of 17Nov24, I'm still running tests... and worried about the automation leap. This will be up sooner rather than later.
