## PMP Certification Project

This project documents my structured path to obtaining the [Project Management Professional (PMP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp) certification. Built on years of practical experience, this repository tracks the certification process from application through examination.

Developed using the official [PMI certification framework](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certification-resources/process) and [exam requirements](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp/earn-the-pmp), and some other noted resources, this project serves as both documentation and resource for the PMP certification journey.

If you've known me personally for awhile, you've known that I've been *talking* about taking the PMP for quite a long time... (c*Ahem, since leaving the Army...*)
